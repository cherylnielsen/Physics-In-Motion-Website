	<h1 class="summary">An interactive 3D Tutorial Lab experience for Students of Physics and Engineering.</h1>
	
	<h1 class="summary">Why Physics in Motion?</h1>
	
	<p class="summary">
	The goal of Physics in Motion is a more intuitive understanding based on the firsthand experience of a subject. Physics and Engineering classes are difficult and have high dropout rates. Attending lectures and reading textbooks is frequently not enough to understand these subjects. A different approach is needed to make the material easier to understand. 
	</p>
	<p class="summary">
	Physics in Motion uses today's powerful interactive online 3D gaming technologies to create a new type of online science tutorial. Not a game, but a visual, immersive, and hands on learning experience in the form of Tutorial Labs that let the Student explore. Each Tutorial Lab is animated and fully interactive to make the topics more approachable, interesting, and informative.

	<h1 class="summary">Tutorial Labs</h1>
		
	<ul class="summary">
		<li>Students perform hands-on interactive experiments and activities directly related to the concepts they are trying to learn.</li>
		<li>Data is collected electronically, as if in a standard industrial lab.</li>
		<li>Students analyze the data with interactive graphs and calculations.</li>
		<li>A Tutorial Lab summary will be provided to Students along with data, graphs, equations, and problems encountered.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h1 class="summary">Automated Mentor</h1>
	
	<ul class="summary">
		<li>The Automated Mentor explains topics, gives hints, and provides corrections as needed.</li>
		<li>If the Student asks for help, the Automated Mentor will highlight problem areas and offer hints.</li>
		<li>The Automated Mentor also looks for errors as the Student solves math equations.</li> 
		<li>Any problems, errors, or corrections are documented as reminders in the Tutorial Lab summary.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h1 class="summary">Professor and Student Services</h1>
	
	<ul class="summary">
		<li>Which Tutorial Labs each Student has been assigned or completed.</li>
		<li>The ability to download Tutorial Lab summaries, data, graphs, and math work submitted by Students.</li>
		<li>Commonly encountered problems, errors, and corrections for Tutorial Labs.</li>
